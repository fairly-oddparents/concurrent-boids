# Assignment #01 -  Concurrent Boids

v0.9.0-20250308

The assignment is about designing and developing a concurrent version of the original [boids simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), as conceived by Craig Reynolds in 1986.

The objective of the assignment is to design and develop a concurrent version of Boid, using three different approaches (producing three different versions):
- Java **multithreaded programming** (using default/platform threads)
- **Task-based** approach based o Java **Executor Framework** 
- Java **Virtual Threads** 
    - Remark: *in Virtual Threads based solution, Executors based on Virtual Threads cannot be used*.

The GUI must provide:
- buttons to start, suspend/resume, stop the simulation
- input box to specify at the beginning the number of boids to be used
- sliders to define the weights for separation/alignment/cohesion 

Remarks:
- Every version (multithreaded, task/executor, virtual thread) should exploit as much as possible  the specific key features of the mechanisms/abstractions provided by the approach, both at the design and implementation level. 
- All versions should promote modularity, encapsulation as well as performance, reactivity. 
- For active components/process interaction, prefer the use of higher level constructs (such as monitors) with respecto to lower level (e.g. `synchronized` blocks). 
- A different language than Java can be used: however, in that case, be sure to identify/adopt/implement equivalent frameworks/mechanisms (threads, tasks, virtual threads) for each version.

For every aspect not specified, students are free to choose the best approach for them.

### The deliverable

The deliverable must be a zipped folder `Assignment-01`, to be submitted on the course web site, including:  
- `src` directory with sources
- `doc` directory with a short report in PDF (`report.pdf`). The report should include:
	- A brief analsysis of the problem, focusing in particular aspects that are relevant from concurrent point of view.
	- A description of the adopted design, the strategy and architecture.
	- A description of the behaviour of the system using one or multiple Petri Nets, choosing the propor level of abstraction.
	- Performance tests, to analyse and discuss the performance of the programs (for each version) compared to the sequential version
	- Verification of the program (a model of it) using JPF. For this point, only the  Java multithreaded programming version may be considered.
